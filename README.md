Description: This program draws a triangle based on specific details inputted by the user. It takes the types of triangle by side (scalene, isosceles, equilateral) 
and by angle (acute, obtuse, right) and proceeds to ask the user for the length of each respective side. Proceedingly, it calculates each angle and displays it
on the screen. If the triangle does not exist or the user inputs faulty data (the triangle does not exist), the output will say so. Made using Python 3.8.1 with 
the Tkinter library.
